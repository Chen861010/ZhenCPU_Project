# CPU_Project
A SystemVerilog-based verification environment for the ZhenCPU, including FSM, ALU, register, memory testing, waveform analysis, and functional coverage.

---

## Overview
ZhenCPU is a simplified CPU designed for instruction-level execution and hardware verification learning.  
This repository contains:

- RTL source code (SystemVerilog) organized per module  
- Self-checking testbenches for each module (ALU, Mem, Mux, Rig, Controller, Counter)  
- CPU-level integration testbench  
- Waveform analysis using Cadence Xcelium + SimVision  
- Formal property verification (FPV) for FSM, registers, counters, and ALU  
- Functional coverage reports for each module and CPU-level tests  
- Instruction program testing environment  

---

## CPU Modules

- **ALU** – arithmetic & logic operations  
- **MUX Units** – data-path selection  
- **Register / Rig** – accumulator & intermediate registers  
- **Controller** – 8-state Moore FSM for instruction sequencing  
- **Memory** – 8-bit data memory with 5-bit address  
- **Program Counter** – 5-bit counter with enable & reset  

All module directories include RTL + testbench + coverage + FPV assertions.

## Verification Features

- ✔ Module-level testbenches (ALU, Mem, Mux, Rig, Control, Counter)  
- ✔ CPU integration testing under CPUwave/  
- ✔ Directed + randomized stimulus  
- ✔ Waveform tracing (VCD/FSDB via SimVision)  
- ✔ Functional coverage (FSM states, ALU opcodes, memory accesses, register operations)  
- ✔ Formal verification (FPV) with bind files  
- ✔ Simulation logs & automated scripts (`runme.sh`, `runcover.sh`, `clean.sh`)
