# CPU_Project
A SystemVerilog-based verification environment for the ZhenCPU, including FSM, ALU, register, memory testing, waveform analysis, and functional coverage.

---

## Overview
ZhenCPU is a simplified CPU designed for instruction-level execution and hardware verification learning.  
This repository contains:

- RTL source code (SystemVerilog) organized per module  
- Self-checking testbenches for each module (ALU, Mem, Mux, Rig, Controller, Counter)  
- CPU-level integration testbench  
- Waveform analysis using **Cadence SimVision**  
- Functional coverage and simulation support using **QuestaSim / ModelSim**  
- Formal property verification (FPV) for FSM, registers, counters, and ALU  
- Instruction program testing environment  

---

## CPU Modules

- **ALU** – arithmetic & logic operations  
- **MUX Units** – data-path selection  
- **Register / Rig** – accumulator & intermediate registers  
- **Controller** – 8-state Moore FSM for instruction sequencing  
- **Memory** – 8-bit data memory with 5-bit address  
- **Program Counter** – 5-bit counter with enable & reset  

All module directories include RTL + testbench + coverage + FPV assertions.

---

## Verification Features

- ✔ Module-level testbenches (ALU, Mem, Mux, Rig, Control, Counter)  
- ✔ CPU integration testing under CPUwave/  
- ✔ Directed + randomized stimulus  
- ✔ Waveform tracing (VCD/FSDB via SimVision or Questa GUI)  
- ✔ Functional coverage using **QuestaSim UCDB**  
- ✔ Simulation logs & automated scripts (`runme.sh`, `runcover.sh`, `clean.sh`)  
- ✔ Formal verification (FPV) with bind files

## Cadence Xcelium + SimVision (`runme.sh`)

`runme.sh` is used for **full CPU simulation** and **waveform debugging** using **Cadence Xcelium** and **SimVision**.  
This script compiles RTL + testbench and opens the waveform viewer.

### Typical Flow

```bash
./runme.sh      # compile + simulate + open SimVision
```

### Internally, the script performs:

```bash
xrun -64bit -access +rwc \
     cpu_tb.sv cpu.sv *.sv \
     -gui
```

### Features

- Fast compile and runtime  
- FSDB/SHM waveform viewing through SimVision  
- Full SystemVerilog assertion (SVA) support  
- Ideal for CPU-level waveform debugging and instruction-level analysis  

### Output Files

- `xrun.log` — simulation log  
- `xcelium.d/` — build directory  
- `waves.shm/` or `.fsdb` — waveform database  
- `simvision_history/` — SimVision GUI state

## QuestaSim Functional Coverage (`runcover.sh`)

`runcover.sh` is designed specifically for **functional coverage** using **QuestaSim UCDB**.  
This script compiles modules, runs the testbench, executes `cover.do`, and writes coverage reports.

### Typical Flow

```bash
./runcover.sh    # compile + simulate + generate UCDB coverage
```

### Internally, the script performs:

```bash
vlib work
vlog *.sv
vsim -c top_tb -do "do cover.do; run -all; coverage report -output cov.rpt; quit"
```

### Features

- UCDB functional coverage  
- FSM, opcode, ALU-path coverage  
- Coverage merging and visualization  
- Compatible with all per-module testbenches  

### Output Files

- `cov.rpt` — text-based coverage report  
- `work.ucdb` — full UCDB coverage database  
- `transcript` — QuestaSim command log  

### Viewing Coverage in GUI

```bash
vsim -viewcov work.ucdb
```

## JasperGold Formal Verification (`run.tcl`)

`run.tcl` is used to run formal verification (FPV) using **Cadence JasperGold**.  
This script clears the environment, analyzes RTL + property files, elaborates the design, and sets clocks/resets.

### Example `run.tcl` Script

```tcl
# Clear the environment
clear -all

# Analyze design files
analyze -verilog \
    source/design/arbiter.v \
    source/design/port_select.v \
    source/design/bridge.v \
    source/design/egress.v \
    source/design/ingress.v \
    source/design/top.v

# Elaborate design and properties
elaborate -top

# Set up Clocks and Resets
clock clk
reset ~rstN
```

### Running the Script

To execute the Tcl script in JasperGold:

```tcl
include run.tcl
```

### Launching JasperGold

```bash
jg
```
